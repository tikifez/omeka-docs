* _privateMethod(): Acceptable.
* _protectedMethod(): Acceptable.
* _publicMethod(): Unacceptable. Only private and protected methods should start with an underscore.
* _filterInput(): Unacceptable. Only private and protected methods should start with an underscore.


Variables
---

* $userId: Acceptable.
* $user_id: Unacceptable. Must be alphanumeric.
* $Userid: Unacceptable. Must start with minuscule letter and be camelcase.

Zend Acl Cheat Sheet
===

Zend's ACL is managed through creation of _roles_ which request access to _resources_.


Roles
---

_Roles_ are objects which request access.

_Zend_Acl::addRole_

1. Role (string)
2. Role to inherit from (string)

TBD



Resources
---

_Resources_ which are objects to which the permission set will be applied, e.g. a specific page.

TBD


Defining Permissions
---

_Zend_Acl::allow_ and _Zend_Acl::deny_
Assigning any of these a null value makes it apply to all types in that parameter.

1. `Zend_Acl_Role_Interface` |string|array $roles
2. `Zend_Acl_Resource_Interface` |string|array $resources
3. string|array $privileges
4. `Zend_Acl_Assert_Interface` $assert


Conditional Permissions through Assertions
---

Conditional permissions are handled by _assertions_ -- classes implementing the _assert()_ method.

```php
class CleanIPAssertion implements Zend_Acl_Assert_Interface {
	public function assert( Zend_Acl $acl, Zend_Acl_Role_Interface $role = null, $resource = null, $privilege = null) {
		return $this->_isCleanIP($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);
	}
	
	protected function _isCleanIP($ip) {
		// â€¦
	}
}
```

The assertion may then be called by a defined rule. Permission will only be granted if the assertion returns true.

```php
$acl = new Zend_Acl();
$acl->allow(null, null, null, new CleanIPAssertion());
```

For more in-depth explanation with the nuances, see the Zend ACL [Advanced Usage](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.acl.advanced.html) page.
